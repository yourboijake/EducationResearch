Summary:
There exists substantial debate about the role that spending on education impacts the ability of student to succeed. While some argue that increased spending is an important way to
improve educational outcomes, others argue that spending is not an effective tool, and that educational institutions should pursue other strategies to help their students.
The topic of spending in education has become a significant component of the public policy debate regarding education policy, and must be addressed. In order to understand the
potential for increased spending to improve performance, we must assess school performance on the basis of spending, and see if increased spending leads to better student outcomes.
This will allow us to identify whether or not increasing spending is a worthy public policy goal.

Data Gathering and Preparation:
The dataset used for this research project comes from https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project, a Kaggle Database compiled from data provided by the
National Center for Education Statistics, the US Census Bureau, and the NAEP National Report card.
The dataset provides information regarding spending, student enrollment, and student test scores in reading and math for all US states from 1992 to 2015. In total, the dataset contains 
1,715 observations across 25 fields, for a total of 42,825 data points.
Firstly, I dropped observations with missing values, which removed all observations prior to 2003, as these observations had some missing data points.
